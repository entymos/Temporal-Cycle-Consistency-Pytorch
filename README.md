# Temporal-Cycle-Consistency-Pytorch
This code is implementation of Temporal-Cycle-Consistency method by using Pytorch.

This is vary interesting method to align two videos containing similar contents (actions, scenes) with the frame-level features of the video.

However this code is very slow because of the specific softmax function for working the method.

If you have any idea to improve the speed, please let me know and I'll update the code as soon as possible.

The method was proposed by Google Brain and Deep Mind team.

Thank you.
